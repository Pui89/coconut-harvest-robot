# Safety Control Boundary

**AI proposes. Deterministic robotics validates. Safety controls.**

YOLO26, Gemma 4 31B IT and future VLA candidates are evidence/planning components. The deterministic validator checks confidence, sensor health, workspace, collision state, exclusion zones, speed, force/torque limits, reachability and E-stop state.

Only the authorized robot-control stack may issue actuator commands. ROS 2 / MoveIt 2 are integration boundaries; actual hardware drivers, calibration, E-stop wiring and applicable safety validation remain hardware-specific.

Missing or contradictory sensor evidence must result in safe hold, abstention, replanning or human review rather than forced execution.
