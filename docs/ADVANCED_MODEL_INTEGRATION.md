# Advanced Generative Simulation and Embodied Action Models

This layer adds four external Hugging Face models to the coconut-harvest embodied-AI stack without bundling their weights.

## 1. LTX-2.5-Diffusers

**Source:** Lightricks/LTX-2.5-Diffusers

Use LTX-2.5 as an offline video/audio world-simulation and dataset-augmentation component. Generate orchard scenes with wind, leaf motion, rain, fog, low light, occlusion, camera obstruction, tool-contact events and recovery scenarios.

It is **not** a runtime robot controller.

## 2. MiniMax H3 Turbo LoRA

**Source:** Pepe104/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-LoRa-UNCENSORED

Use the Space as an offline audio-visual scenario generator for rare orchard events, difficult visibility conditions and recovery/failure datasets. Any production use must pass license, provenance, content and safety review.

It is **not** a runtime robot controller.

## 3. NVIDIA GR00T N1.7 3B

**Source:** nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-3B

Use GR00T as an embodied-action policy candidate for imitation learning, skill transfer and simulation-to-real experiments. Candidate skills include approach, grasp, cut, retract and verify.

GR00T outputs proposals that must pass the deterministic planner and safety gate before execution.

## 4. FLUX 3 Action Base

**Source:** black-forest-labs/flux-3-action-base

FLUX 3 Action Base is treated as an adaptation component for world/action prediction. It can condition on camera frames, robot state and language and produce candidate action chunks together with future video.

Important: this repository is an **action base, not a complete coconut-harvesting policy**. A new embodiment needs its own action head and validation.

## 5. Google Gemma 4 31B IT

**Source:** google/gemma-4-31B-it — [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-31B-it)

Gemma 4 31B IT is the high-level multimodal reasoning layer for orchard images and task context. It can analyze coconut targets, ripeness/quality cues, branch and workspace risk, occlusion, and uncertainty before a harvest candidate is sent to the deterministic planner.

The repository includes a runtime adapter at `src/coconut_harvest_robot/gemma4.py`. The model weights are downloaded at runtime and are not committed to GitHub; the Hugging Face repository is about 62.6 GB. Transformers and vLLM are supported by the model card.

Gemma is **advisory only**. It never sends motor, cutter, gripper, or arm commands. Any proposed harvest decision must pass target verification, workspace/collision checks, human-exclusion checks, joint/force/torque limits, confidence gating, and the emergency-stop path.

## Safety invariant

Reasoning decides **what should happen**. The planner decides **how to execute it**. The deterministic safety controller decides **whether execution is allowed**.

No generative, VLM or action foundation model may bypass collision checking, workspace limits, human exclusion, force/torque limits or the physical emergency stop.
